  In this work, we present AcOrch, a sampling-based GNN training system optimized for CPU-NPU heterogeneous platforms. AcOrch offers fine-grained task orchestration and adopts a two-level pipelined execution model to overlap sampling, gathering, and training. It analyzes the heterogeneous compute features of NPUs and maps tasks to AI Cube (AIC) units, AI Vector (AIV) units, and CPU cores accordingly.
