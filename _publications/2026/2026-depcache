  We introduce dependency attention, a novel graph-aware attention mechanism that restricts attention computation to token pairs with structural dependencies in the retrieved subgraph. Unlike standard self-attention that computes fully connected interactions, dependency attention prunes irrelevant token pairs and reuses computations along shared relational paths, substantially reducing inference overhead. Building on this idea, we develop DepCache, a KV cache management framework tailored for dependency attention.
